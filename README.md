# **Tourism Data Regression Analysis**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing **GDP** using multiple linear regression and interaction modeling. The project explores relationships between **tourism receipts**, **tourism exports**, and other key predictors, incorporating interaction effects to understand their combined influence. The analysis is conducted using Python, with visualization of results using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Analysis**: Preprocessing and exploration of tourism-related predictors and GDP data.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression with interaction terms.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of regression results and interaction effects.
- **Refinement**: Comparison of models to identify the best-fit model using adjusted R-squared, significance testing, and residual analysis.

## **Project Highlights**
✅ Regression diagnostics and multicollinearity checks.  
✅ Visualization of relationships between GDP and predictors using best-fit lines and confidence intervals.  
✅ Suggests and evaluates refined models for improved interpretability and performance.
