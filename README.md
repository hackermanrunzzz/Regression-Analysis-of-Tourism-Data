# Regression-Analysis-of-Tourism-Data

## This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing GDP using multiple linear regression and interaction modeling. The project explores relationships between tourism receipts, tourism exports, and other key predictors, incorporating interaction effects to understand their combined influence. The analysis is conducted using Python, with visualization of results using Plotly and Matplotlib.

# Key Features
### Data Analysis: Preprocessing and exploration of tourism-related predictors and GDP data.
### Modeling: Implementation of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with interaction terms.
### Visualization: Graphical representation of regression results and interaction effects.
### Refinement: Comparison of models to identify the best-fit model using adjusted R-squared, significance testing, and residual analysis.

# Project Highlights
### Includes regression diagnostics and multicollinearity checks.
### Visualizes relationships between GDP and predictors using best-fit lines and confidence intervals.
### Suggests and evaluates refined models for improved interpretability and performance.

# Requirements
### Python 3.7+

# Libraries:
### pandas
### numpy
### statsmodels
### matplotlib
### plotly

# Usage
### Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook or scripts for a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis. This project is ideal for those exploring regression modeling, interaction effects, and GDP analysis.

# Future Scope

### Incorporate additional machine learning models for comparative analysis.
### Expand the dataset to include more predictors and time periods.
